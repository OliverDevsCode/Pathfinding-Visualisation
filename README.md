# Pathfinding-Visualisation
A visual interface for Dijkstra's algorithm and A* Algorithm

#Demo Page
https://oliverdevscode.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualisation/

# How-to-use

 # Adding-Nodes
  To add a node first click ADD NODE then double click where you would like the node to be place

 # Linking-Nodes
  To add a link first click LINK NODES then double click the first node, and then double click the second node, they are now linked

 # Solving Path
  To solve the path select the algorithm you would like from the dropdown select either Dijkstra or A* (Only Dijkstra has been implemented so far) then press the SOLVE BUTTON
